while posting the data, from body -> request -> json data -> Node JS doesnt know that it is a JSON which has to be converted to Javascript object.
Express has a function that converts json to javascript object.
Therefore, instead of mentioning to every API methods =>
    app.post('/movies', express.json() ,async function (req, res)
we commonly use =>
    app.use(express.json()); //express.json() => inbuilt middleware

npm i dotenv //To create a new environment variable
create .env => and add this to gitignore (Key=Value)
import dotenv from 'dotenv' & add dotenv.config();
