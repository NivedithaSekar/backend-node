whatever changes we make while the server is running, it wont be reflected. 
For that, We have to cut the server and re-run it.
So this is a trouble to cut & re-reun the server for every changes..So to automate this install a package called nodemon
npm i --save-dev nodemon

//manually added
in package.json =>
    "start": "node index.js" //to initiate => npm run start or npm start
    "dev": "nodemon index.js" //to initiate => npm run dev


while posting the data, from body -> request -> json data -> Node JS doesnt know that it is a JSON which has to be converted to Javascript object.
Express has a function that converts json to javascript object.
Therefore, instead of mentioning to every API methods =>
    app.post('/movies', express.json() ,async function (req, res)
we commonly use =>
    app.use(express.json()); //express.json() => inbuilt middleware

npm i dotenv //To create a new environment variable
create .env => and add this to gitignore (Key=Value)
import dotenv from 'dotenv' & add dotenv.config();
Value is available in => process.env 
and can be retireve from process.env.Key


In Herokku, Port Number cannot be demanded. So after deploying the code, we receive error.
So local env => put the port number
Herokku => Port is autoassigned but DB has to be configured via settings(key:Value)
